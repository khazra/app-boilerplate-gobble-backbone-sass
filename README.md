# App Boilerplate - Gobble, Babel, Browserify, Backbone, Sass, Bootstrap v4

## Installation

```
npm install && bower install
```

## Usage

```
gobble
```

and code :)

Mocha tests are not working to well, I think for testing in browser it is easier to setup them using html runner instead of console runner.

I hope gobble will continue to grow to be a popular tool.
